Website of games and activities for young children (&lt;6yrs)
Pages to be included will be: main index, ABC matching game, simple number counting, simple addition and subtraction, a touch based drawing app, and later a 2d driving/jump game.

Designed to be mobile first, and should fit medium tablets(7") and desktops .
